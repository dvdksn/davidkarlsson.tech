I have 8 years of experience working with product documentation.
During this time, I have had the opportunity of working with many
different aspects of technical writing, including:

- Vector illustrations
- 3D graphics and animation
- Technical writing
- Conversion and migration
- Information architecture
- Tools development

## Background

I started my career in visual communication. I studied technical illustration,
creating technical 2D vector and 3D graphics.
Soon upon starting to work, I also got into writing.
That was also when I was first introduced to structured writing in XML.

With time, I grew more and more interested in tools and frameworks.
I began working with conversion and data migration projects.
Those typically involved moving unstructured or semi-structured content
into a topic-based information architecture and a CCMS.

For years have evangelized DITA, and content strategy projects became my
primary occupation.

## Present

Nowadays, I have largely moved away from XML-based tooling, in favor of
[docs as code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/).
As I spent more time I spent in software projects,
it became obvious to me that the traditional tools stack didn't quite
satisfy the needs of agile software development.
Technical writers need a way to keep up with the pace of developers.
I believe that docs as code is the way to do that.

As a side-effect of deep-diving into git workflows and static site generators,
I've gotten heavily invested in web development. And I love it! That personal
interest is main reason behind creating this website.

## About this site

The code for this site is all available on
