I have 8 years of experience working with product documentation.
During this time, I have had the opportunity of working with many
different aspects of technical writing, including:

- Vector illustrations
- 3D graphics and animation
- Technical writing
- Conversion and migration
- Information architecture
- Tools development

I currently work for [Ericsson](https://ericsson.com) as an information architect.

## Background

I started my career in visual communication. I studied technical illustration,
creating technical 2D vector and 3D graphics.
Soon upon starting to work, I also got into writing.
That was also when I was first introduced to structured writing in XML.

With time, I grew more and more interested in tools and frameworks.
I began working with conversion and data migration projects.
Those typically involved moving unstructured or semi-structured content
into a topic-based information architecture and a CCMS.

For years I supported clients with DITA consultation, and content strategy
projects became my primary occupation.

## Present

For the last couple of years I have been pre-occupied discovering the
world of [docs as code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/).
As I spent more time in software projects,
it became obvious to me that the traditional tools stack didn't quite
satisfy the needs of agile software development.
Technical writers need a way to keep up with the pace of developers.
It seems to me like docs as code is the way to do that.

As a side-effect of deep-diving into git workflows and static site generators,
I've established an interest in web development, and development in general. 
And I love it! (My wife will vouche for me.)
